#What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
It's a lot more difficult than I expected.  It gave me a bit of a headache trying to get everything aligned the way I wanted to and took a bit more research on my part to get it working.  That said padding, borders, and margin are all essential to a well laid out website.

#What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I learned how specifically to place individual elements on a page, then use margins and padding to determine where they should fall on a page and how much space should be between them.

#What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The hardest to implent is still trying to get it to appear exactly as I want it to.  I think my HTML/CSS implementation went well and it looks much better but still isn't exactly like I envisioned.  I thought implementing the actual CSS was the easiest part, but getting the positioning to work exactly how I wanted took some time.

#What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned that it makes your HTML code a lot cleaner.  Instead of trying to do all the formatting in one document, CSS allows you to reference your sheet and keep elements a bit less convuluted in the acutal document.  I also learned that a lot of trial and error is involved in figuring out where and how to place elements.  Having my local page open while I edited code was extremely helpful for me to see changes in real time.  It allowed for a bit of easy trial and error while going about spacing and placement.
