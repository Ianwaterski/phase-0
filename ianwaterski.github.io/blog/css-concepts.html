    <h1> Margins, Borders, and Padding oh my! </h1>

    <hr />
  <p>This is a topic that definitely took some research to nail down for me. All three of these terms relate to the spacing of objects in relation to each other in some way or form. Let me start out by including an image that was immensely helpful before I attempt to explain any further.</p>

  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-blog/assets/ae09140c.png">

<p> So this image was the single best example for me in how to describe the difference between these terms.

  <ul>
    <li><b>Margin</b> is what I tried to edit to make papers seem longer when they weren't quite long enough. In my mind its the edge of your page whether it be physically in paper, or the dimensions of a website. The margin of an object clears an area around the outside of an object, has no color, and is completely transparent. If you want a buffer zone around the outside of a bordered object this is the property you would use.</li></br>


    <li><b>Border</b> The border property was the most straight forward for me to understand. It allows you to draw a border around a specific element, and then define its properties. If you have a text object, you can surround it in a frame and then edit its width, color, and style. Width is defined in pixels "border-width: 15px", or by pre defined values of thin, medium, or thick. The color can be defined in hex, name, or RGB value. Finally the style of the border is defined by set styles such as dashed, dotted, solid, or double as a few examples.</li></br>

    <li><b>Padding</b> refers to the space between the border and the element it surrounds. In short its the distance between the element and the border. It is defined in pixels with a format padding-(top, bottom, left, right): 10px;.</li></br>
