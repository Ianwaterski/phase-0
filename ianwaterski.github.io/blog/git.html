  <h1>Git and Version Control</h1>
  <h2>Why version control is awesome</h2>

      Before diving head first into how Git/GitHub works technically, I think understanding why they do what they do is essential first. Git and GitHub are designed to work in tandem to aid developers in productivity and clarity when editing files on projects.  It puts in place a gated style of editing so that all people involved have the opportunity to see submissions and who/when they were submitted.  This allows all members involved to see what's being edited and how so that nothing can be thrown in to the mix that may derail previous work.  This by definition is version control, and an essential practice in developing code effectively.

        So now that a bit of understanding of version control works, and why it's important, learning about how Git/GitHub work together is the next step.  Git is a local app that works through terminal to allow you to edit files on your machine wherever you are.  Since it is on your machine you can do this offline anywhere you like.  GitHub is an online repository for all developers to store their code remotely.  That way if you need to get something from someone half way around the world, it's as easy as going to GitHub and cloning what you need to your computer (There's a few more steps but for the sake of example this works).  GitHub is a very dynamic DropBox for developers to share and edit code easily from wherever they may be.

        In as few words as possible Git is how your machine and GitHub communicate.  With a few commands in terminal you can upload and save your work to GitHub where other members of your team can work in tandem with you to finish a project.  GitHub is the drop box where all of your work is saved to prevent any kind of loss of work.  Both of these together off a number of gated save points to ensure that work of different people is not overwritten when working together, and also offers lots of documentation on who is editing what and when.
