What is a one-to-one database?
A one-to-one database is a database that has a relationship between two entities that references the same object.  In the video it uses the example of a loan, then more details about that loan that are less relevant on an intial query.

When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
When you wanted to make an initial query easier to navigate.  In the video they use the example of a loan and how there could be 100+ entries in one entity.  In order to streamline queries you want to only make the most important information available initially, but still allow access for other queries.

What is a many-to-many database?
A many to many database is a list of entities which have multiple references to each other.  There are many different lists which all have different specific items.  "An Author can write several Books, and a Book can be written by several Authors."

When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
When there is a direct relationship between two entities that contain items from each other.

What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
One to one is pretty easy to understand, but many to many is a bit confusing.  The example I found of "an Author can write several Books, and a Book can be written by several Authors" was helpful but it still confusing to adapt that comparison to other subjects.
