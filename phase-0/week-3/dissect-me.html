      Before diving head first into how Git/GitHub works technically, I think understanding why they do what they do is essential first. Git and GitHub are designed to work in tandem to aid developers in productivity and clarity when editing files on projects. It puts in place a gated style of editing so that all people involved have the opportunity to see submissions and who/when they were submitted. This allows all members involved to see what's being edited and how so that nothing can be thrown in to the mix that may derail previous work. This by definition is version control, and an essential practice in developing code effectively.

  What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
    In this document specificailly we used nav, footer, section, and main.  I return to footer, main, and nav pretty frequently throughout my HTML coding because I think they are a great way to offer some clarity to other people who may jump into the project and want to know what each section is for/doing.  Other than using comments it offers a great inline way to describe what each section does.

  How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
    Elements get laid out on a page from top to bottom, and the browser reads them in the same way.  Whatever is at the top of your HTML document will appear at the top of your website.  It makes writing HTML similar to writing an essay or reading a book.  You start at the top with a header and work your way down through the body of the document to the footer.  Along the way it is useful to use the HTML5 tags described earlier to document other sections along the way.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
  I learned that snippets are a thing.  I will definitely be creating more snippets along the way.  I scheduled this GPS at the end of my HTML/CSS week and really wish I wouldn't have so I had that little bit of info to save me some time.  It's really great to have that HTML skeleton in place already when you start to avoid any missed closing tags, or tags in general.  I think from here on out I'll do some more research to add smaller snippets along the way to possibly simplify adding specific common sections to websites.  Maybe a better snippet for nav/link sections to a website that streamline the process off adding long lines of code that are found in many websites.
