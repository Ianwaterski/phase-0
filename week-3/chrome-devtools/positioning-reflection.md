#How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
By being able to view changes in real time while editing, the DevTools allows you to play with values in formatting and position until you get it where you want it.  By using different position values you can arrange items anyway you like and see how the layout will be affected before finalizing changes.

#How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
You can resize elements in the DOM by using height and width in the stylesheet.

#What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Relative positioning positions objects based on the position of the other elements inline with the current object.  It allows you to move one object and keep the others inline as if the object was still where it was previously.

Absolute positioning allows you to place the object wherever you want as if it takes up no space.  For example you could place an object on top of another and not effect the other objects in anyway.

Fixed positioning is similar to absolute except that it stays in the viewers vision at all times as they scroll through your page.  Similar to annoying pop up windows that continue to follow your view down a page regardless of how far you scroll.

Static positioning allows the object to be positioned in its current place in the flow.

#What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
Margins are the space between the edge of the "page" and all content.  Border is the space between margin content. Padding is the space between border and content.  My best description of this concept is still a visual one with boxes illustrating their spacing.

#What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
It was interesting to play around with the DevTools and see what they could do in this challenge.  Other than that I thought this challenge was one of my less favorite.  It was hard to tell how the elements should be placed on the page area and how much they could just be finessed into place by using different pixel values of the objects.  It was easy to make the page I was looking at look like the example but I wasnt sure if that was the best or most effective way to do so.  I found myself changing pixel values to arbitrary numbers just to get objects placed where they should be, but was unsure how that would work in an actual website.
