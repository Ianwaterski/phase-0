<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into   an actual site?
  Feels good.  Learning something from text/videos is always informative but nothing really compares to the ability to hands on apply what I've picked up.  It was also cool to be able to see the changes/edits I made to my site as I was doing them.  It made making changes or progressing much easier to deal with.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  I picked up a recommended book for HTML/CSS and have loved it so far.  Using the internet has always been an easy solution but being able to look something up in a book was awesome.  The book itself is also really nice to look at from a design stand point which only made it easier to look at, and more willing to use.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  Pretty well I think.  Because the target website was formatted so minimally it made sticking to a non formatting HTML style pretty easy.  It was basically just text and an unordered list which was very straight forward.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  The good seems like it's very easy to pick up, since it's a markdown language its easy to just read through with some knowledge of tags and understand what it's doing.  The bad in my opinion is that without proper code formatting it becomes very difficult for me to read and breakdown.  ie: idents and easily followable tag paths.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  I'm not sure I have any other than what's worked for me with everything else so far, which is repitition, repitition, and some memorization.  Being exposed to it more regularly is going to be a big factor in being able to apply it, so researching on my own as well as working on challenges will be a big factor.
