#What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a rough draft of the layout of your website.  By using place holder objects you can lay out specific pages in the way you would like them to appear on the live site.

#What are the benefits of wireframing?
The benefits of a wireframe are very similar to a rough draft.  It allows you to lay everything out in a skeleton/foundation and build from there.  This allows you to give your project a mock up look from you to develop on top of.

#Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
Yea I thought it was very enjoyable.  It was fun to desing a layout for a site that I will be adding a bunch of work to later.  Really made me value the work that people dedicate to laying out complex websites when you compare how few elements my site will have.

#Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I had a general idea in my head of what I wanted the website to look like but ended up making several changes along the way.  I started by laying out everything I wanted on my website then took time to figure out which would be the most effective way to present them to a user for navigation and clarity.  I also looked at other sites for inspiration along the way.

#What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
What is the clearest way to lay out my site? What is the easiest/robust wireframe webapp I can use to make this look professional? Does this wireframe look like something I would look at live on the internet?  Various links from the challenge helped me on my way to figuring out the answers, some were the actual links, some were links that I clicked through from the challenge links.

#Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I really enjoyed just laying out the wireframe in general.  It was a fun departure from flat out coding.  It was interesting to think about how you could lay out a website in a wireframe in order to make it approachable and easily display information.  The most tedious part was trying to find a wireframe app that would be easy to use and easy to export from.  Even that wasn't exceptionally tedious but it was the only thing of note in this challenge.

#What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is basically a rough draft/layout of a specific page for a website.  You use wired boxes as place holders for objects on your website, such as images or navigation buttons, in order to get a better idea of how your website will look.

#What are the benefits of wireframing?
Wire framing gives you a jumping off point as far as diving into development of a website.  By using a wireframe you can easily lay out the elements of your page in the simplest form possible.  From there you develop up and elaborate on your sketch of the website.  This allows you to basically make the skeleton and add elements on top of it to build a website to completion.

#Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I thought it was awesome.  I took a bunch of time just laying stuff out in different ways trying to figure out which worked best or looked coolest.  I visited a couple sights and tried to look at them in my minds eye as a wireframe for inspiration or ideas.  It was a fun exercise that allowed me to experiment and be creative.

#Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I made a couple different wireframes.  At first I slapped a few things down before I started to realize that Mockingbird had a drag and drop centering ability, so that threw off my first mock up for the better.  From there I developed a rough sketch and kind of added on bits and bobs as I figured out new things and explored the app.

#What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
A lot of the questions I asked during this were what was the best resource to make a wireframe easily, and also what way I could easily incorporate that offline.  I spent a bunch of time experimenting with different wireframing web apps and programs to figure out which was best.  Since I currently don't have the Adobe Suite I eventually opted for Mockingbird.  While basic at first definitely has all the features available to build a well put together wireframe.

#Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I really enjoyed just laying out a bunch of mocked up wireframes.  I thought it was fun to take that first step into developing a site that I would ultimately pour some work into to make functional.  Finding out a bit more about designing a website graphicailly rather than on the development side was something I haven't had much of a chance to explore so that was also fun.  This overall was one of the more enjoyable challenges for me and there really wasn't an aspect I found tedious at all.  Maybe researching a wireframe app that was free and robust, but even that was easy.
