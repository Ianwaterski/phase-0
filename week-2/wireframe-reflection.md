#What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a rough draft of the layout of your website.  By using place holder objects you can lay out specific pages in the way you would like them to appear on the live site.

#What are the benefits of wireframing?
The benefits of a wireframe are very similar to a rough draft.  It allows you to lay everything out in a skeleton/foundation and build from there.  This allows you to give your project a mock up look from you to develop on top of.

#Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
Yea I thought it was very enjoyable.  It was fun to desing a layout for a site that I will be adding a bunch of work to later.  Really made me value the work that people dedicate to laying out complex websites when you compare how few elements my site will have.

#Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I had a general idea in my head of what I wanted the website to look like but ended up making several changes along the way.  I started by laying out everything I wanted on my website then took time to figure out which would be the most effective way to present them to a user for navigation and clarity.  I also looked at other sites for inspiration along the way.

#What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
What is the clearest way to lay out my site? What is the easiest/robust wireframe webapp I can use to make this look professional? Does this wireframe look like something I would look at live on the internet?  Various links from the challenge helped me on my way to figuring out the answers, some were the actual links, some were links that I clicked through from the challenge links.

#Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I really enjoyed just laying out the wireframe in general.  It was a fun departure from flat out coding.  It was interesting to think about how you could lay out a website in a wireframe in order to make it approachable and easily display information.  The most tedious part was trying to find a wireframe app that would be easy to use and easy to export from.  Even that wasn't exceptionally tedious but it was the only thing of note in this challenge.
