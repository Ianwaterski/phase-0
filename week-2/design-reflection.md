#What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
The six phases are, information gathering, planning, design, development, testing, and maintenance.

#What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
The primary purpose of my site is to provide information about myself.  It will provide specific information about myself, contact information, current projects, and personal info about me.

#What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience will be potential employers and I am to make this website easy for them to navigate while also giving them all pertinent information about myself in a streamlined fashion.  I think their interest's will be trying to figure out why they want to employ me and what credentials I have that make me employable.

#What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
The primary action I want users to take when coming to my website is looking at the showcase of my current projects, whether it be potential employers or just colleagues.  From there hopefully they will take the time to get in contact with me via listed contacts or take the time to read a liitle bit about me personally.

#What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
Some of the main things someone should know about design/UX are target audience, that UX is not one size fits all, UX is not easily measured and either are the results, gathering information is as important as good design, and finally that good planning makes for more time effective development/design.

#What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
User experience is how someone feels when they interact with a system.  The most concise answer is that it deals directly with users that will be using the system you are designing.  If users do not like the interaction they are having with said system, that experience is valuable information to use going foward to make changes to the system.

#Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Figuring out a good way to draw the sitemap and get it pushed to Git was tedious.  I don't really have a good draw based program on my machine so finding something that would work well and be easily added to my reflection file was a chore.
