#What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
Information gathering, planning, desigin, development, testing, maintenance.

#What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My site's primary goal is to deliver information. It will feature content that helps illustrate my current portfolio to prospective employers.

#What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience's interesting will be information about me hopefully, my site will try to effectively portray the most important information about myself in an organized and efficient way.  I hope to keep it streamlined so users don't get bogged down by too many pages.

#What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
The primary action I want users to have when coming to my website is viewing my portfolio and contacting me.  When users other than prospective employers visit my site I would like them to view information about me or about the social networks I'm involved in.

#What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
Information gathering and planning are just as important to actual development.  Taking in to account a user's experience while viewing your website are critical to developing a site that get's a purpose across effectively.  UX is not something easily measured with current metrics.  UX is important because it deals directly with users' needs.

#What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
User experience is how a user feels after interactiong with a system.  It is valuable because the users' experience is what drives improvement or changes to a website in order to make it a better experience for users.  Development of websites is done with users in mind so user driven design is essential for good websites.

#Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
The most tedious part for me personally was drawing out the site map because I have no real drawing based applications on my machine.  That said most of the challenge was very straight forward and easy to understand.
