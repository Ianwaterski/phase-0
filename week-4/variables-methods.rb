#How do you define a local variable?
``` ruby

```

##How do you define a method?

def method_name(parameters)
  what method does
end
```

##What is the difference between a local variable and a method?
#A local variable is only usable in the method that it's defined.

##How do you run a ruby program from the command line?
#ruby filename.rb

##How do you run an RSpec file from the command line?
#rspec filename.rb

##What was confusing about this material? What made sense?
#Most of it made sense.  I had some trouble with outputing the method in one exercise that was resolved by asking for help.  I was trying to output within the method instead of after when calling the method.
