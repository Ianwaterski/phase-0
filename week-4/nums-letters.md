#What does puts do?
Puts prints to screen whatever comes after it.

#What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a number without a decimal point while floats are numbers with decimals.

#What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
When you do math with integers you will get integer answers. That is if you get an answer with a remainder you will only get the whole number, not the number and its remainder. 5 divided by 2 will return the answer of 2 and not the actual answer of 2.5 because you used only integers.

```ruby
puts 24*365 ' hours in a year'
puts ((60*24)*365)*10 ' minutes in a decade'
```
