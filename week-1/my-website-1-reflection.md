#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To create a repository on github head to github.com and to your profile page.  Once there click on the repo you wish to clone.  Copy the url in the HTTPS box and then open terminal.  In terminal navigate to where you want to clone the repository to.  Once in the directory type "git clone" and after clone paste the URL copied from GitHub.

#Describe what open source means.
Open source means that all code written for a project is available to the public.  Instead of code being private amongst your team, code that is open source is free for anyone to look at or edit.

#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
It makes me a little nervous and protective.  Despite there being an enormouse amount of code out there for people to view its a little intimidating to put my own code out for everyone to see.  To go along with that I naturally feel a little protective over it because of the work I put into it, it has a certain "its my baby" type of feel.

#Assess the importance of using licenses.
Software licenses are important because it grants certain rights to other developers in regards to specific code usage.  Developers may want to make certain sections of code available so that others in the industry can adapt their code's compatibility and also make their code more widely used.

The major advantage to a license though protects code against usage a developer may not want.  In order to legally use code under license, the license has to state that such use is acceptable.

#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
This challenge helped me solidfy any questions I had in regards to GitHub pushing and pulling.  In the previous challenge I was struggling to completely understand how GitHub was communicating with Git locally in order to merge files from my local machine to GitHub.  This exercise further illustrated how the two were communicating and how I could effectively make the two work.

#Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I did a few google searches in order to do a bit more research on software licensing.  I didn't find a specific resource which helped tremendously, but a few average places that together helped describe the legal protection a license offers code.
